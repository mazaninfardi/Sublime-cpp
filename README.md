# Sublime-cpp
This is a C++11 package for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) that provides a set of commonly used C++11 snippets and allows you to compile codes written using C++11 syntax and methods. In addition this package adds syntax highlighting to the compilation error output of gcc which makes the errors readable and clickable within Sublime Text. Make sure to select C++11 from the build menu.
